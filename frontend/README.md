# LayerX Bridge
## Project

- The latest version of LayerX Bridge is used vuejs to build
- LayerX Bridge was created to give users a better cross-rollup transaction experience, greatly reducing the economic and time costs of interaction between L1 and L2, such as L1<->L2,L2<->L2.
- As a proof-of-concept project, LayerX Bridge currently supports ERC20 token transactions on mainnet, zkSync, Arbitrum.

## Functional

- Running this project requires setting the necessary parameters, which support each rollup node.

- By configuring the parameters, the project can realize the economic and time savings that users can make by LayerX Bridge when configuring the rollup dynamics. After the user initiates payment through the front-end wallet, it will monitor the transaction data of each rollup in real time and feed back the real-time status of the user's cross-rollup transfer in time.
